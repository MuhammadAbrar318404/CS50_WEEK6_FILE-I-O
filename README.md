# CS50_WEEK6_FILE-I-O
This is week6 of the CS50P which was about the File handling, list. open. with. sorted. CSV. dict. csv. PIL, this repo contains the project files that i have designed to implement the theoretical knowledge. This week, the projects revolved around file handling, data manipulation, and image processing. Let's dive into each project:

---

#### 1. Counting Lines of Code (LOC)

In `lines.py`, I created a program that counts the number of lines of code in a Python file, excluding comments and blank lines. It reads a Python file as input, validates the file's existence and extension, then counts the lines of code excluding comments and blank lines. The result is printed to the console.

#### 2. Pizza Price List Formatter

The `pizza.py` program formats a CSV file containing Sicilian pizza prices into a tabular format using ASCII art, leveraging the `tabulate` package. It reads the CSV file, validates its existence and extension, then formats the data into a visually appealing table, which is printed to the console.

#### 3. Data Cleaning: Splitting Names

`scourgify.py` cleans data in a CSV file by splitting combined names into first and last names. It reads an input CSV file, separates the combined names, and writes a new CSV file with separate first and last names along with other data. This program ensures that each student's name is correctly formatted for further processing.

#### 4. Virtual T-Shirt Try-On

`shirt.py` virtually tries a t-shirt on an image by overlaying a shirt image onto a person's photo. It resizes and crops the input image to match the shirt's dimensions, then overlays the shirt onto the resized image. The resulting image, showing the person wearing the virtual shirt, is saved as an output file.

These projects showcased my ability to work with files, manipulate data, and perform image processing tasks using Python. Each project tackled a different aspect of file and data handling, contributing to my overall proficiency in Python programming.
